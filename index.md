### CPSC 120

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was a favorite because it was amazing to see that we wrote a code that would tell you the population of a county in California. The process of writing this code was fun because we had to gather all the counties of california as well as the population for each one and store them into a 2D vector. If the user entered a false county or misspelled it, It would return a list of all the counties in Calfiornia. 

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was a favorite because it was our first lab project that involved creating Clases. Classes is a very interesting to me because you can literally make a Class for anything you can think of. In this lab, we made Classes about states in the United States. This lab involbed with the name of the sate, land area of the state, and the population of the state. 

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was a favorite because we created a gif USING CODE. I never thought that i would be able to create a moving image using only code. We are able to create visuals and objects using code. This lab was my most favorite because it showed me that coding has endless fields of opporunities. This was just the beginning and i can't wait to see what new things i learn in the future.
